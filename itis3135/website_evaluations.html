                    A website created to celebrate the annual San Diego Design Week. It shows off the many different artworks and designs that people have submitted.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast: The background color is a dark brown, so the white and colored text really pop out and are easy to read.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition: Consistent use of the same font family, weight, and colors throughout the website. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment: Items are aligned with good amounts of spacing between different topics of interest
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity: Related content is nicely grouped together in a consistent and pleasing manner with consistent spacing differentiating them from other sections of content.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Poorly Designed Website: <a class="web-example" href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
                <figure>
                    <img class="web-example-img" src="images/yale_school_of_arts_website.png" alt="">

                <p>
                    Surprisingly, the website for a School of Arts isn't so well designed at all. It is meant to be a collaborative workspace for publishing and sharing information.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast: The colors on this website are eye searing, the bright neon yellow and green boxes just makes your eyes hurt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition: Not much repetition (other than the background) as there isn't an easily distinguished pattern to the content, instead the content are in boxes of different colors seemingly at random.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment: The content isn't aligned in a pleasing way as the content are shifted to left leaving a lot of wasted space to the right. There also isn't a consistent spacing between different elements either.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity: Related content isn't grouped together consistently, some boxes of related content have large spaces in between them while having smaller spaces in between unrelated content.
                    </li>
                </ul>
